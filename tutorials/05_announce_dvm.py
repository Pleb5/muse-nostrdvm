# Let's have again a look at our main DVM from tutorial 02.
# All previous descriptions of what's happening has been removed, so refer to exercise02 to see whats going on.
# In this tutorial we want to focus on announcing our DVM so clients can find it.

    # it will announce the DVM on Nostr, it is set to false by default here, so you don't accidently do it, but feel free to set it to true

    # it includes a profile like announcement of what the DVM can do, including an image, a name and a description.
    # NostrDVM also supports encrypted requests so we add the flag encryptionSupported
